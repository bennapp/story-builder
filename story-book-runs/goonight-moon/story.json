She was feeling a bit scared, so she decided to tell her own version of Goodnight Moon. She started by saying goodnight to the room, which she had filled with all the things she loved. She said goodnight to her teddy bear, her dolls, her books, and her favorite blanket. Then she moved on to the objects outside her window - the moon, the stars, the trees, and the flowers. As she said goodnight to each one, she felt a little bit of courage and comfort fill her heart.", "Finally, Emma said goodnight to the Quiet Old Lady Whispering Hush to the very last page of the book. As she said the last words, a peaceful feeling filled her heart and she felt safe and secure in her bed. She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, dreaming of a world filled with love and peace.", "The next morning, Emma awoke with a smile on her face.
