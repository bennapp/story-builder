{"title": "\"Bluetiful's Brightness: A Crayon's Tale\"", "pages": ["Once upon a time, in the magical world of crayons, there lived a young crayon named Bluetiful. Bluetiful was unique from the other crayons, in that he had a face and looked like a character from Pixar. He was also not the sharpest crayon in the box, as he struggled to keep up with the other crayon kids.", "The other crayons noticed Bluetiful's difference, and didn't accept him for it. They made fun of him and called him names. Two crayons in particular, Sea Green and Tumbleweed, were especially mean to Bluetiful and bullied him often.", "Bluetiful was determined to make the other crayons accept him, so he worked extra hard to be like them. He worked hard to learn how to draw and color like the other crayon kids, and soon he was able to keep up with them.", "The other crayons noticed Bluetiful's hard work and began to appreciate him. They noticed that while he wasn't the sharpest crayon in the box, he was the brightest crayon in the box. Even Sea Green and Tumbleweed began to respect Bluetiful and stopped their bullying.", "Bluetiful had overcome the bullies and proved to the other crayons that he was just as capable as them. He had become the brightest crayon in the box, and was accepted by the other crayons. Bluetiful was an example of how, no matter how different someone may be, they can still be accepted into a group of people."], "art_style": "drawn with crayons", "run_name": "bluetiful-2"}
