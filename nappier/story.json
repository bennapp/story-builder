{"title": "\"A Surprise Ho-Ho-Visit from Santa\"", "pages": ["It was a chilly Christmas eve, and the Nappier family was getting ready for the holiday. Dennis and Gretch were busy in the kitchen preparing Christmas dinner, while their two sons Ian and Ben were playing in the living room.", "As the night wore on, the boys got more and more excited for Santa Claus to arrive. Little did they know, Santa was already there! Just as the family settled down for the night, they heard a loud \u201cHO HO HO\u201d coming from the living room.", "When the Nappiers ran into the living room, they were in for a huge surprise. Santa was there! But, instead of being the jolly old fellow they were expecting, Santa was actually a very grumpy old man. He was grumbling about how he was running late, and he just wanted to finish up his deliveries and get home.", "The Nappiers were a bit taken aback, but they decided to help Santa out. They quickly got to work helping him find the right presents and wrapping them up. Santa began to relax and eventually started to enjoy himself.", "Soon enough, Santa was back in the living room, ready to hand out the presents. But as he began to hand out the presents, something strange happened. Every present that he gave out made a funny sound! As it turns out, Santa had accidentally wrapped up some of his toys instead of the presents he was supposed to deliver!", "The Nappiers couldn't help but laugh as Santa tried to figure out what was going on. Eventually, the presents were all sorted out and Santa was able to finish his deliveries. As he said goodbye, Santa wished the family a very merry Christmas and said that he'd be back next year for sure.", "The Nappiers had an unforgettable Christmas that year. Every time they think back to that night, they can't help but smile as they remember Santa's funny mistake."], "art_style": "Goodnight Moon", "run_name": "nappier"}
