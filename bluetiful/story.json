He was not the sharpest crayon in the box, and growing up he struggled to be like the other crayon kids. They made fun of him and called him names, like \u201cBluetiful the Dull\u201d. Bluetiful had two main bullies, Sea Green and Tumbleweed. They would tease him about his dull color and his dull personality.", "Bluetiful was sad and lonely, feeling like he did not fit in with the other crayons. He tried so hard to be like them, but nothing seemed to work.

He noticed that when he held his crayon up to the light, his color was the brightest and most beautiful of all. He realized that he had been blessed with a unique gift, a special color that was unlike any other crayon.", "Inspired by his newfound discovery, Bluetiful was determined to show the other crayons that he was special. He worked hard to sharpen his colors and brighten his hues. Soon, Bluetiful was the brightest crayon in the box and the envy of all the other crayons.", "Finally, Bluetiful had overcome the bullies, Sea Green and Tumbleweed. He could finally hold his head up high and be proud of who he was. Bluetiful was now a shining example of what it means to be a crayon, and the other crayons welcomed him into their group.
